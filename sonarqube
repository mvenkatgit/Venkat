Code Review : Verifying the code against the standards

Code Coverage : How many lines of source code is tested by unit test cases

Employeeservice.java
100 lines 



90 % code coverage
80 % should get pass


it's a code quality management tool
continuous code quality

it's open source for some languages 

cross platform means it can be executed in any platform

it will support multi OS platfome (Windowsx`, MAC, Linux..)
it will support multiple databases (My sql, Oracle, Microsoft SQL server, Postgretsql)
supports multiple browsers (IE, Microsoft Edge, FF, Chrome,safar)
it will identifies the below catefory of issues,

Code smells

sonarqube server generates the report and it stores in the data base
in built data base called H2 in sonarqube 


web server it's going to get the report and it will show by using webserver as a default


Search enginee one of the component to get something in sonarqub server

sonarqube we need to start it as a sonar user 


####we should mention the sonar credentials in pom.xml under properties


to generate the mvn package
mvn sonar:sonar



sonar:sonar {first sonar is for plugin name second sonar is goal name}
sqa_436492b7d6e33cdd3b737b1f30bab2f294480224

 <sonar.login>sqa_7658a94730c8e09b9e6a11b9ab7fdf2c5ef8bbee</sonar.login>

one sonar token can be used for only one time

npm run sonar
or node sonar-project.js

to run node js project's


instead of pom.xml we should use sonar-project.js file to modify for ip address of sonar

to install 
yum install nodejs -y
install npm


HAMEVh#%%195
HAMEVv#%%195


to add extra rules we should add under quality profiles tab


when we add the custome rules we can specify as a default by clicking in settings symbol 


quality gates : collections of conditions 


we can change the port number in /conf/sonar.properties 


sonar.projectName=harsha
sonar.projectKey=com.hr
